Description:
### My final proposal idea is to make a pixel character that is generated with pythongame that you can move around with "wasd" and collect slime balls on the application.
### The character will be a slime ball
### Will try to make it so that if you collect 10 slime balls then the screen will flood with slime and the game will end

The main mechanic of the program is that it generates a large slime ball character and smaller slime balls. The larger slime ball character is able to move around with "wasd" and can collect the smaller slimes. When they colide, the smaller slimes will vanish and a point counter will increase. Upon collecting 10 slimes on the point counter, the game will display a you win message and the screen will be flooded with slime pixels. Then the game will reset and you can play again. When you want to exit the game you can hit "esc" to close the application.
