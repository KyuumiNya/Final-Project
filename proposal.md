# Final Proposal

### My final proposal idea is to make a pixel character that is generated with pythongame that you can move around with "wasd" and collect slime cubes on the application.
### The character will be a slime ball 
### Will try to make it so that if you collect 10 slime cubes then the screen will flood with slime and the game will end

Features:
-Generated slime character
-generated slime cubes to be collected
-slime collected number on screen
-slime character can move wity "wasd"
-when 10 cubes are collected the screen floods with slime and the game ends

The challenge will be to execute all of these seperate features and have everything still working by the end
My ideal outcome is to at least have the slime be able to move and collect the cubes while displaying how many have been collected. Then once 10 are collected, the game will end.
My minimal viable outcome is to at least have my slime be able to move and collect the slime

I'm not exactly sure what my weekly milestones will be since I usually do things mostly at the same time for many hours, but I want to at least be able to get the slime character displayed and get it to move early on. Then get the slime cubes to display and be collected/display the number collected. Then have the game end with the slime transition screen once 10 have been collected.
