# Final Proposal

### My final proposal idea is to make a pixal character that is generated with pythongame that you can move around with "wasd" and collect slime cubes on the application.
### The character will be a slime ball 
### Will try to make it so that if you collect 10 slime cubes then the screen will flood with slime and the game will end
